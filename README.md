# Checkers-in-Assembly
Checkers in PDP-11 Assembly

This project was created for homework in Atam course in Technion University, as a final project.

This is a working project, made for the PDP-11 simulator.
I uploaded both the .s11 and .o11 files.

Anyone who wishes to use this code, can use it freely.

If you have any questions about the code, let me know.
